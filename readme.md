# My Reflection

I believe i met all basic requirements for this assignment, I have enjoyed this assignment alot more than some of the others. I wasnt able to achieve the stretch goals, I did try the delete button but it kept messing my form up or stopping my database from showing on my page. I would really like to be shown how to do this just so I can understand it. I would have attempted the like button but i just felt it wouldnt have been aesthetically pleasing to my form.
Although things went better this time for me I did have a problem with post but I found this wasn't working mainly due to typo's, which has been the cause for most of my minor issues when they have appeared.
One thing i struggled with was as a new message was posted it wouldn't automaticaly scroll to where the new message was, after some googling i found and implemented a solution with a coupele trial and errors along the way.
I think my styling could have been alot better but im struggling with whats the best way to use media queries, but I will keep researching this for the future.
